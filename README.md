##  Rock Paper Scissors – Python Game

A simple command-line Rock Paper Scissors game built using Python.  
This project helped me practice core programming concepts like loops, conditionals, user input, and randomization.

---

##  Features
- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer
- Random computer choices using Python’s `random` module
- Score tracking for both user and computer
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully
- Option to quit the game anytime

---

##  Technologies Used
- Python 3
- `random` module

---

##  How to Run the Project
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system
2. Clone the repository or download the `.py` file
3. Open a terminal in the project directory
4. Run the game using:

   python rock_paper_scissors.py

##  How to Play
- Type `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors` when prompted
- The computer will randomly choose its move
- The winner is decided based on standard rules:
  - Rock beats Scissors
  - Paper beats Rock
  - Scissors beats Paper
- Type `q` to quit the game

##  Sample Output
Computer picked rock.
Woohoo.. You won!

##  What I Learned
- Working with loops and conditional statements
- Using dictionaries to simplify game logic
- Handling user input and edge cases
- Writing cleaner and more readable Python code

---

##  Future Improvements
- Best-of-3 or Best-of-5 game mode
- Add emojis or colors for better UI
- Convert the game into functions
- Create a GUI version
